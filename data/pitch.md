# Personal Pitch

I'm a data scientist based in London with a background in Computer Science and Business Analytics.  
I enjoy turning messy datasets into actionable insights that drive real business outcomes.  
I've delivered projects across gaming (Rockstar Games), financial services (Coalition Greenwich), and retail (Pricerite Wholesalers).  
My strength is combining technical rigour — PySpark pipelines, predictive modelling, optimisation — with clear, business-focused communication.
