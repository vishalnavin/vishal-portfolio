# Recruiter-Style Q&A

**Why should we hire you?**  
Because I combine strong technical expertise (PySpark, ML, SQL, Tableau) with the ability to explain results to non-technical stakeholders. My work at Rockstar and Coalition shows I can bridge analytics with decision-making.

**What's your biggest achievement?**  
At Rockstar Games, I helped design a clustering pipeline on millions of player records that revealed new churn drivers — insights that shaped engagement strategies.

**How do you handle challenges?**  
By breaking them into structured steps. For example, when facing incomplete telemetry data, I used feature engineering and clustering to still surface actionable insights.

**What's your leadership style?**  
Collaborative. In group consulting projects, I coordinated tasks, ensured consistent data quality, and kept the team aligned on deliverables.

**Where do you see yourself in five years?**  
As a data scientist/analytics consultant leading projects that merge machine learning with business outcomes, ideally in gaming or finance.
