# Projects â€” Rockstar Games

- Analysed GTA Online telemetry (~100M+ rows) using **PySpark** pipelines in **Databricks**.  
- Built a **retention model** labelling players as acquired, retained, churned, or resurrected.  
- Engineered player features and ran **KMeans clustering** to group player behaviours.  
- Developed sequential models of daily activity flows (spawn, economy, Freemode interactions).  
- Conducted **spatial analysis** of player movement in high-traffic areas.  
- Investigated churn patterns and transitions between clusters over time.  
- Outcomes: improved understanding of player engagement and retention drivers, informing game design decisions.
