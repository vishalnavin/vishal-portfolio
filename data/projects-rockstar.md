# Rockstar Games Internship

Vishal joined Rockstar Games in London as a Data Science Intern, working on GTA Online telemetry. He developed a sequential model of daily player activities using economy transactions, spawn events, and flow data, with a focus on Freemode interactions.  

He created retention labels (acquired, retained, resurrected, churned) and integrated them into clustering analysis. Using PySpark, Databricks, and KMeans, he explored clusterâ€“retention relationships, churn patterns, and spatial behaviour across player segments.
