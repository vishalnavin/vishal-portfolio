# Rockstar Games Internship

Vishal joined Rockstar Games in London as a Data Science Intern, working on GTA Online telemetry. He developed a sequential model of daily player activities using economy transactions, spawn events, and flow data, with a focus on Freemode interactions.  

He created retention labels (acquired, retained, resurrected, churned) and integrated them into clustering analysis. Using PySpark, Databricks, and KMeans, he explored clusterâ€“retention relationships, churn patterns, and spatial behaviour across player segments.

## Key Achievements
- **Player Behaviour Modelling**: Built sequential models analysing daily GTA Online player activities using PySpark and Databricks
- **Retention Analysis**: Developed comprehensive retention labelling system (acquired, retained, resurrected, churned) for player lifecycle analysis
- **Clustering & Segmentation**: Applied KMeans clustering to identify distinct player segments and their retention patterns
- **Spatial Analysis**: Investigated player spatial behaviour and movement patterns across different game modes
- **Tools Used**: PySpark, Databricks, Python, scikit-learn, SQL, data visualisation

## Impact
- Improved understanding of player engagement patterns and churn drivers
- Enhanced player segmentation for targeted interventions and retention strategies
- Provided actionable insights for game design and player experience optimisation
